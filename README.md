Analyze delays and status breakdowns in the order delivery pipeline.
Improve coordination among Sales, Warehouse, and Logistics teams.
Visualize KPIs like delivery time, late orders, and order statuses.

**Tools & Technologies**

Microsoft Excel (for tracking and processing)
Power BI (for creating interactive visual dashboards)
Formulas Used: IF, VLOOKUP, DATEDIF, COUNTIFS, Conditional Formatting
Dataset Source: Kaggle â€“ E-Commerce Public Dataset
